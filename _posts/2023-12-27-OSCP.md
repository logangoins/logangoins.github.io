## The Key to Perfecting the OSCP Methodology

### A little Bit about me
I'm a Cybersecurity major at UTSA with a long history of tinkering with technology. I love breaking things down and understanding them, and I absolutely love penetration testing and offensive security. I love doing machines on HacktheBox and I have two previous certs, CySA+ and Security+, and I passed OSCP a few weeks ago as my third Infosec certification.

### The First Step - Entering the "Try Harder" Mindset

Trying Harder is a lifestyle, it’s a way of thinking. It’s never giving up, no matter how difficult things get.

When it comes to pen-testing methodology, this directly relates. Staying optimistic and continuing to test everything that you possibly can even in the most hopeless situations. Any potential vector could theoretically grant you command execution or present you with a finding, showcasing how important it is to test each vector thoroughly, from start to finish, from zero to one hundred.

### Training for the Exam
The OSCP exam is not just a test of skill or technical knowledge, it’s also a test of perseverance, time management, and reporting abilities. Offsec specifically tests an exam taker’s ability to adapt to situations, and do research on previously unknown vulnerabilities and knowledge, and utilize them to successfully exploit each system.


The best training possible for this exam is the practice exam labs available on the PEN-200 platform, being the OSCPA, OSCPB, and OSCPC. These exams will give the closest experience to the OSCP exam including the pivoting and Active Directory lateral movement.

If you desire additional practice for strictly initial access and privilege escalation methodology, HacktheBox machines on TJNull’s OSCP list are great practice. His list can be found here:
