![Active](https://github.com/shellph1sh/shellph1sh.github.io/assets/55106700/7c2fbd6a-d6cd-4115-94bb-d4d95cc8f9dd)

Active is an easy box on the HacktheBox platform, featuring anonymous SMB shares leading to cached credentials through a Group Policy Preferences (GPP) file, Kerberoasting all Service Principal Names (SPNs), including cracking the credentials embedded in a TGS, and authenticating to the box as Administrator.

### Enumeration
First off, utilize a Nmap scan to enumerate the machine, utilizing default NSE scripts and version enumeration.

A few services indicate that this is a Microsoft Windows Active Directory Domain Controller, including the Kerberos, LDAP, and Microsoft DNS services.

Now that we know this is a DC, we can use crackmapexec to learn a little more about the domain, including the DC hostname and domain name. We can also use crackmapexec to test for anonymous SMB bindings, and sure enough, this DC accepts anonymous bindings and gives us read access to a backup share called "Replication".

We can then authenticate to the backup share:


```
smbclient -N \\\\10.10.10.100\\Replication
```

And dump all the files onto our host system with `smbclient`

```
recurse ON
prompt OFF
mget *
```



We quickly find this backup share contains group policy files, including a Group Policy Preferences (GPP) file. We enumerated the Windows Server version, Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1. Windows Server 2016 R2 and before, have a “cpassword” entry inside of their GPP xml file tied to the “active.htb\SVC_TGS” user. This field is encrypted with a publicly disclosed AES-32bit key, allowing us to decrypt the field with public tools. In our case we’ll use “gppdecrypt”.

We were able to successfully decrypt the password for the SVC_TGS user. We can use the domain user credentials to test for common AD authentication attacks: including AS-REProasting attacks, and Kerberoasting attacks.

The Administrator user is registered as a Service Principal Name (SPN), meaning we can request a Kerberos ticket for an SPN. The retrieved Kerberos ticket is encrypted with the hash of the service account password affiliated with the SPN, meaning we can crack the hash offline.

And we cracked the Administrator hash! We can now authenticate to the domain controller using PsExec, WmiExec, or some other form of remote administrative command execution.
